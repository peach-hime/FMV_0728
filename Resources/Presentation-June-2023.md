## FMV History

**2014** - Hollnagel, Erik.
"My intention has always been to have the basic tools as open source, but then to build commercial extensions such as a simulation package (running the instantiations, so to speak) and some kind of 'calculation of variability' package. An other possibility is a dynamic simulation."

**2014** - FMV version 0.1 (to 0.4) Adobe Flash Builder  
Reinvented the FMB - FRAM Model Builder, adding visualisation.  
The basic tools for building and visualising FRAM models
